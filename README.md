# Kolkata Covid Help Website

## Usage

You'll need to have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), the `bundler` gem, and [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) (`npm` also works) installed on our computer. Summer provides a fully furnished Jekyll setup â€” just clone and install the dependencies:

```bash
# Ruby gems
bundle install
# Node modules
yarn
```

Then simply run `yarn start` to start the Jekyll server on port `4000`.

## Local Development

2. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/kolkatacovid/kolkatacovid.github.io.git`
3. Empty out the url in `_config.yml`
4. The steps below will serve your site locally
  ```bash
$ cd kolkatacovid.github.io
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
``` 
5. View the website at http://127.0.0.1:4000/
